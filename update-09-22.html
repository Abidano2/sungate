        <div class="progress_update">

            <p>A whole year has passed since the start of this game yet it feels like it's only been a few months... </p>
            <p>As you can see, the game has its very own website now! It doesn't have much content right now but it'll definitely be used more in the future.</p>
            
            <p>For the people who have no clue what this is since I've only just started to share it more, SUNGATE is a Japanese-style RPG inspired by games such as <a href="https://www.deltarune.com">Deltarune</a>, 
            so if you're into those kind of games I guess this is for you? I can't really talk about what the game is about as of now so pretend like it's some sort of 
            surprise (I can't 100% promise it will be a good one though as this is my first full game...).</p>
            
            <p>Now, this introduction has been going on for too long so why don't we talk about progress more?</p>

            <h5 style="font-family: Mainbold;">Development</h5>

            <p>In terms of development, most of it was focused on design, specifically story-writing, for the past year. 
            Some parts of the beginning were implemented including a dialogue system however I decided to restart all of it as they were very messy and the systems didn't work properly. 
            So only the chapter select screen has been fully completed so far.
            </p>

            <p>In terms of the story, most of it is complete. Main characters/bosses are all known, general progression is known, main locations are know and so on. If I get the time, I might finish it all completely by the end of this year!</p>
            
            <h5 style="font-family: Mainbold;">Preview</h5>

            <p>So while not much actual implementation was done, why not show some unused (and some that may be used) content?</p>

            <h5 style="font-family: Mainbold;">Closing Thoughts</h5>
            <p>So yeah, mostly design stuff, and if I'm lucky hopefully writing will be finished by the end of this year.</p>
            <p>In terms of people helping me with the game, I have some who I'm going to be talking to about how we'll be approaching the design and implementation of the game together. However, we're still 
            looking for a pixel artist and a music composer, so if you're interested or know someone who is please contact me at "abidano#0567" on Discord.</p>
            <p>Other than that, that's it for now! Thank you!</p>
